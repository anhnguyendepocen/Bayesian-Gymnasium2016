# Bayesian-Gymnasium2016
This is a repository for the lecture notes and code for an introductory
graduate-level class on Bayesian statistics that I am developing. The class is
taught using R and the Stan programming language. Each lecture's code is
separated into a file for the Stan models and a file for the execution and
processing code.
